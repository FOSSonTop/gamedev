The general flow of the project will be:
1. Scene Handling 
    - Setting up `Node2D`
    - Using Collision Shapes
    - Navigating scripting options
2. Planning Logic, and then implementing them (You are here)
    - We need many elements like:
        - Ball being able to bounce
        - Board that you bounce the ball against
        - Handling the Up/Down input and moving the Boards
        - The ball should reset position if it crosses the edges
