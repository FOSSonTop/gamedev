# Software Choices
## Game Engine

In today's world, we have 3-4 major Engines for versatile 2D/3D Game Development.
### Unreal Engine 4/5(Proprietary, [Royalty Based](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/license))
- Pros: Very Beautiful Graphics
- Cons: Difficult to use for low-spec Development systems, alienates low-spec end players. This means that it needs a very powerful PC with a dedicated Graphics Card to do any meaningful work on Unreal Engine. Not an Option❌
### Unity(Proprietary, [Personal and Pro Tier](https://unity.com/products/pricing-updates))
- Pros: Extensive Community and Official Documentation
- Cons: Concerning recent stance on game monetization by company, even though it was undone. Needs Pro for many features. Not an Option❌
### GameMaker Studio(Proprietary, [Free(Non Commercial) and Pro Tier](https://gamemaker.io/en/get))
- Pros: Avid Community, and tutorials. Easy to get started with
- Cons: Restricted to `Non Commercial` on free tier. Not an Option❌
### Godot(Open Source, [MIT License](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt))
- Pros: Growing Community with huge potential and good 3D support for an Open Source Engine. Can fully own your game. Can even modify source code of the engine itself if needed. Matches our needs! :checkmark:
    - Very lightweight, the whole engine is wrapped inside a 150-250 MB archive.
- Cons: C# support is not prioritized despite advertising it.
