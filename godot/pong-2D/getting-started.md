> [!NOTE]
> While this is an OSS Guide, we are targeting a more mainstream audience so these screenshots were taken on windows. 

You need to go to the [official download link](https://godotengine.org/download) inside the browser. Since we're going to be using windows, it automatically redirected us to the windows page.

> [!TIP]
> For this guide, we will be downloading the regular one because we aren't using the .NET features.
